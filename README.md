Sidewalk colorscheme for Vim
-----------------------------

A simple and distinctive colorscheme. Distinctiveness and distinguishability are more important than noisiness.  We can filter out information we don't need, so the goal is to make important terms easier to notice and improve scanning.  Naturally the appearance of code depends heavily on the base syntax. I've looked at Java, Idris (vim-idris), Haskell, Erlang and Elixir (vim-elixir). These vary heavily, with idris and elixir using identifier infrequently, erlang a ton and haskell and java not at all

Many of the colors are meant to resemble sidewalk chalk, hence the name.

Features & Contributions
------------------------
I currently only include a dark theme. Any contributions (additional themes, missing highlights, etc) are welcome.
